`"`The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power.We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal.`"`

`"`We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.`"`
